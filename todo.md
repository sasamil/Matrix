1) SparseMatrix - pivoting.

2) Comments in english

3) Filtering. Omiting redundant functinality.

Since I use Eigen, which is very good, simple and fast, I hardly find time and sense for working on this implementation of SparseMatrix. It is difficult job but it is challenging and I enjoy in it. Let's hope there will be further improvements.
